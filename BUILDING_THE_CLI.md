## Building the CLI

We have included some NPM scripts to help create various installations of the CLI and in this section we will include instructions of how to:

- [Compile TypeScript to JavaScript](#compiling-typescript)
- [Package the CLI into executables](#building-executables)
- [Link the CLI with NPM for local development](#npm-link)

### Compiling TypeScript to Javascript

We are using the TypeScript command `tsc` to compile the code to JavaScript and the output of which is put into the `dist` directory.
A NPM script has been created to run this compile step and can be utilised if you want to just use the raw JavaScript.

The command to achieve this is:

```bash
npm run build
```

### Building Executables

**Prerequisites**:

- [ronn](http://rtomayko.github.io/ronn/ronn.1.html) is required to convert the markdown HOW_TO_USE.md to the manpage

To support the use of the CLI as a standalone application within Windows, Linux and Mac OS we have added a step to export the code as an executable.
This step can be achieved by running the command:

```bash
npm run build:package
```

The output of this command will be three executables within the packages directory, one for Linux, Mac OS and Windows:

- dc-cli-linux
- dc-cli-macos
- dc-cli-win.exe

Creating a versioned zipped set of executables is also achievable using the following command:

```bash
npm run build:compress
```

Where the output of this command will also be created in the packages directory, they will now be zip files for each OS with a version:

- dc-cli-linux-1.0.0-0.zip
- dc-cli-macos-1.0.0-0.zip
- dc-cli-win-1.0.0-0.zip

<a name="npm-link"></a>

### Linking with NPM for local development

To run the CLI locally via the command prompt for local development the application must first be [compiled](#compiling-typescript).
Once compiled the CLI can then be linked with NPM to act like it has been installed, to achieve this we can run the script:

```bash
npm link
```

This will then allow the CLI to be used as if it was an executable like so:

```bash
dc-cli COMMAND --param1 foo --param2 bar
```
