.
.SH "FACETS"
The content item export, copy, move archive and unarchive commands allow the user to provide a facet string to filter the content that the commands work on\. Multiple of these can be applied at a time, and you can even match on regex string\. Note that you will need to surround your facet in quotes if it contains a space, which will change how backslash escaping works\.
